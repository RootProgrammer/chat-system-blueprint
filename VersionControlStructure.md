# Version Control Structure

## 1. **Main Branch**:

- **Purpose**: Serves as the primary branch where the source code always reflects a production-ready
  state.
- **Management**: Direct commits to this branch are typically restricted. Changes are merged
  into `main` only after thorough testing and review.

## 2. **Development Branch** (optional but recommended):

- **Purpose**: Acts as a staging area for all development work before it's ready to be released into
  production. It reflects the state of the next release.
- **Management**: Features, bug fixes, and other branches are merged into `development` before being
  promoted to `main`.

### Branching Strategy

#### 1. **Feature Branches**:

- **Naming Convention**: `feature/<feature-name>`, e.g., `feature/login-functionality`.
- **Purpose**: Each new feature is developed in its own branch to isolate changes. This makes code
  reviews, testing, and collaboration easier.
- **Lifecycle**: After completion, a feature branch is merged back into the `development` branch (or
  directly into `main` if you're not using a `development` branch) via a pull request.

#### 2. **Bugfix Branches**:

- **Naming Convention**: `bugfix/<bug-description>`, e.g., `bugfix/login-error`.
- **Purpose**: Similar to feature branches but specifically for bug fixes. They ensure bugs can be
  addressed without interfering with ongoing feature development.
- **Lifecycle**: Merged back into the main branch (or `development` if used) once the fix is
  verified.

#### 3. **Release Branches** (optional):

- **Naming Convention**: `release/<version>`, e.g., `release/1.0.0`.
- **Purpose**: Prepare for a new production release. Allows for final testing and minor bug fixes
  without the addition of new features.
- **Lifecycle**: Once the release is deemed stable, it's merged into `main` and tagged with a
  version number. It's also merged back into `development` to ensure any changes made in the release
  branch are not lost.

#### 4. **Hotfix Branches**:

- **Naming Convention**: `hotfix/<issue>`, e.g., `hotfix/critical-login-failure`.
- **Purpose**: Address urgent issues in production. Hotfixes are created from the `main` branch and
  must be immediately deployable once fixed.
- **Lifecycle**: After the fix, the hotfix branch is merged into both `main` and `development` (if
  used), ensuring that the production fix is propagated back into the development workflow.

### Best Practices

- **Pull Requests**: Use pull requests for merging any branch into `main` or `development`. This
  facilitates code review and discussions before integrating changes.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate CI tools to run tests automatically on pull requests to
  ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.
- **Branch Cleanup**: Regularly delete branches that have been merged to keep the repository tidy
  and manageable.

This structure and strategy provide a solid foundation for managing project development, enabling
teams to work on different aspects of the project simultaneously while maintaining code quality and
facilitating easy integration of changes.
